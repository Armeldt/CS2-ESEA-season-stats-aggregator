This project is designed to provide CS2 esports enthusiasts with an advanced tool for in-depth analysis of official match data, whether from online or LAN tournaments, ESEA seasons, and more.

The project is divided into two main components:

## 1. Stats Aggregator

- Offers detailed player statistics, emphasizing individual performance within the team. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include fragging ability, utility usage efficiency, clutching, team play, and more.

- Provides team statistics (e.g., overall wins/losses, map-specific win rates, closest wins, largest losses) from all demo files uploaded by the user.

## 2. Single Match Analyzer

- Focuses on a detailed analysis of a specific match, offering an in-depth view of game progression. This tool is ideal for post-match debriefs and team preparation for upcoming opponents.

The project is developed in Python, utilizing the demoparser2 library by LaihoE for demo analysis, and Custom Tkinter for the GUI.
