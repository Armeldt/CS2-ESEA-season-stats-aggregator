This project is designed to provide CS2 esports enthusiasts with an advanced tool for in-depth analysis of official match data, whether from online or LAN tournaments, ESEA seasons, and more.

The project is divided into two main components:

## 1. Stats Aggregator

- Offers detailed player statistics, emphasizing individual performance within the team. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include fragging ability, utility usage efficiency,team play, and more to come.

- Provides team statistics (e.g., overall wins/losses, map-specific win rates, closest wins, largest losses) from all demo files uploaded by the user.
  
- Give access to raw data tab for in depth analysis

To be added : 

- Specific player profile: Includes best and worst-performing maps, ADR, KD ratio, playstyle insights, and other key metrics, serving as a "player card" to showcase strengths when seeking a new team.

## 2. Single Match Analyzer (To be built)

- Focuses on a detailed analysis of a specific match, offering an in-depth view of game progression. This tool is ideal for post-match debriefs and team preparation for upcoming opponents.

The project is developed in Python, utilizing the demoparser2 library by LaihoE for demo analysis, and Custom Tkinter for the GUI.

So far a first version of the Stat Aggregator will be available very soon, here are some screenshots of the UI :
