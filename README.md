This project aims to provide in-depth data from CS2 matches for subtop competitive teams, helping them analyze and improve their performance, for example, throughout ESEA seasons.

The project is divided into two tools:

1. Season Stats Aggregator:

  - A tool that compiles both basic and advanced stats from multiple games (such as an ESEA season). The goal is for players to track their performance across the season with detailed stats and visualizations, which they can also share on social media, especially when looking for a new team.

2. Single Match Analyzer:

  - A tool focused on the detailed analysis of a specific match, offering an in-depth view of game progression. This tool is designed to facilitate post-match debriefs or help teams prepare for upcoming opponents.

The primary focus is to deliver advanced stats such as clutches, trade kills, utility efficiency, and economic insights.

This project is developed in Python using the demoparser2 library by LaihoE.
